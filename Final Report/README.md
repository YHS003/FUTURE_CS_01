## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the findings from a hands-on vulnerability assessment performed as part of an internship exercise. The assessment targeted a web application deployed for learning purposes (test environment) and focused on common web vulnerabilities mapped to the OWASP Top 10. Four verified issues are included in this report: SQL Injection (authentication bypass), DOM XSS (search), Broken Access Control (credential brute-force), and Security Misconfiguration (exposed `/ftp`). Each finding includes impact, evidence references, remediation recommendations, and OWASP mapping.

**Overall risk:** The combination of an authentication bypass and exposed admin credentials constitutes a high-to-critical risk to the application. Immediate remediation is recommended for authentication-related issues and exposed sensitive files.

## Scope

* **Target:** (insert application name / URL / environment)
* **Testing window:** (insert date range)
* **Tools used:** Burp Suite Community Edition, Browser (DevTools), Kali Linux (optional), manual testing techniques.
* **Excluded:** No destructive testing or interaction with production systems. All testing performed in a controlled/test environment.

## Methodology

1. Reconnaissance: explored public endpoints, reviewed `robots.txt`, and identified input parameters (e.g., `q` in search).
2. Manual testing: used Burp Suite proxy to intercept and manipulate requests, attempted SQLi payloads and DOM payloads, and validated server responses.
3. Focused exploitation: where vulnerabilities were confirmed, collected PoC artifacts (screenshots, request/response captures, Burp saved items).
4. Documentation: sanitized and stored artifacts in PoC folders and compiled findings into this final report.

## Findings (detailed)

### 1) SQL Injection — Login (Authentication Bypass)

* **Severity:** Critical / High
* **Description:** The login endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection. A tautology payload injected into the username field allowed authentication bypass and retrieval of an admin email address.
* **Evidence (PoCs):** `SQLi Login Page/PoCs/Request.txt`, `SQLi Login Page/PoCs/Response.txt`, `SQLi Login Page/PoCs/Screenshot_Browser_Admin.png`, `SQLi Login Page/PoCs/Screenshot_BurpSuite.png`, `SQLi Login Page/PoCs/Authentication_bypass` (Burp saved item).
* **Impact:** Full account takeover, data exposure, unauthorized administrative actions.
* **OWASP mapping:** A03:2021 — Injection (SQLi).
* **Remediation:** Use parameterized queries / prepared statements, validate and sanitize inputs, apply least-privilege DB accounts, suppress detailed DB errors, and re-test after fixes.

### 2) DOM XSS — Search Parameter

* **Severity:** Medium — High (context dependent)
* **Description:** The `q` search parameter is reflected into the DOM unsafely, allowing execution of attacker-supplied JavaScript via a DOM XSS vector. Non-script payloads (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>`) succeeded where direct `<script>` tags did not.
* **Evidence (PoCs):** `DOM XSS Search/PoCs/DOM_XSS_Payload_Screenshot.png`, `DOM XSS Search/PoCs/Result_of_Payload_Screenshot.png`.
* **Impact:** Client-side code execution in victim browsers, potential cookie/session theft, UI manipulation, and phishing.
* **OWASP mapping:** A03:2021 — Injection (client-side / script injection), guidance from XSS prevention rules.
* **Remediation:** Properly encode/sanitize data inserted into the DOM, avoid `innerHTML` with untrusted data, use `textContent` or safe DOM APIs, implement CSP, and add client-side XSS testing in CI.

### 3) Broken Access Control — Credential Brute-force

* **Severity:** High
* **Description:** After obtaining an admin email (via SQLi), a targeted brute-force attack using a ~100-entry public password list and Burp Suite Community Edition identified the admin password `admin123`.
* **Evidence (PoCs):** `Broken Access Control/PoCs/Intruder_Grep-Match.png`, `Broken Access Control/PoCs/Intruder_Password_BruteForce.png`, `Broken Access Control/PoCs/Intruder_Sucess_Request.png`, `Broken Access Control/PoCs/Intruder_Sucess_Response.png`. Passwordlist stored in `Broken Access Control/Passwordlist/`.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, privilege escalation, administrative access.
* **OWASP mapping:** A01:2021 — Broken Access Control; related to authentication failures (A07/A02).
* **Remediation:** Enforce rate-limiting and progressive delays, account lockouts/alerts, MFA for privileged accounts, strong password policies and denylists, and bot/credential-stuffing protections (CAPTCHA, WAF).

---

### 4) Security Misconfiguration — Exposed `/ftp` Directory

* **Severity:** High
* **Description:** `robots.txt` lists `/ftp` as disallowed, but the directory was publicly accessible. Directory listings and confidential files were retrievable without authentication.
* **Evidence (PoCs):** `Security Misconfiguration/PoCs/robots_file_screenshot.png`, `Security Misconfiguration/PoCs/access_to_forbidden_folder.png`, `Security Misconfiguration/PoCs/access_to_forbidden_files.png`, `Security Misconfiguration/PoCs/acess_confidential_data.png`.
* **Impact:** Sensitive data exposure, information leakage useful for further attacks, regulatory & reputational risk.
* **OWASP mapping:** A05:2021 — Security Misconfiguration.
* **Remediation:** Remove sensitive files from web-accessible locations, disable directory listing, enforce authentication/authorization for sensitive directories, fix file permissions, and avoid relying on `robots.txt` for protection.

## Risk Summary & Prioritization

| Finding                             | Likelihood |      Impact |            Priority |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------: | ----------: | ------------------: |
| SQL Injection (login)               |       High |    Critical | Immediate (Fix now) |
| Broken Access Control (brute-force) |     Medium |        High |  High (within days) |
| Security Misconfiguration (/ftp)    |     Medium |        High |  High (within days) |
| DOM XSS (search)                    |     Medium | Medium-High | Medium (patch soon) |

**Recommendation:** Prioritize the SQLi fix and credential protections first, then lock down exposed directories and remediate DOM XSS.

## Conclusion

This assessment identified multiple high-impact vulnerabilities that together pose a critical threat to the application's confidentiality and integrity. Immediate remediation of SQL injection and credential protections is strongly recommended, followed by configuration hardening and client-side sanitization. The artifacts in the repository support these conclusions and can be used to validate fixes.
